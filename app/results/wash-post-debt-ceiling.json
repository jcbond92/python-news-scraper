So far, Democrats and Republicans have not settled on a joint strategy for how to proceed, an impasse that could have major economic consequences within days.", "analysis": {"neg": 0.095, "neu": 0.831, "pos": 0.073, "compound": -0.3923}}, {"textData": "Speaking at the White House, Biden threw responsibility for a potential U.S. default \u2014 which would be an unprecedented event in American history \u2014 on Republicans who have refused to lend their votes to help Democrats avert the debt ceiling cliff.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementAsked if he could guarantee the debt ceiling would be resolved, Biden said: \u201cNo, I can\u2019t. That\u2019s up to Mitch McConnell.\u201dBiden added: \u201cI can\u2019t believe that will be the end result, because the consequences would be so dire \u2026 But can I guarantee it? If I could, I would. But I can\u2019t.\u201dBiden\u2019s alarming comments came amid an intensifying standoff as Republicans continue to refuse to help Democrats avert the debt ceiling cliff.The debt ceiling sets the maximum amount the U.S. is able to borrow under federal law. Failing to raise it is widely expected by economists to risk financial and economic calamity, as the federal government would be forced to miss payments, such as Social Security checks to seniors. The federal government spends much more money than it brings in through revenue, requiring it to borrow the balance by issuing debt.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementBiden likened the possibility of a debt default to the prospect of a \u201cmeteor headed to crash into our economy,\u201d warning of higher interest rates and saying the public could feel the impact as this week as financial market jitters sink in.McConnell sent the White House a letter Monday reiterating that the GOP would not provide to help Democrats to resolve the impasse. McConnell has been adamant that Democrats need to use the budget procedure known as reconciliation to approve the debt ceiling hike with only 50 votes. Democrats only control 50 votes in the 100-seat Senate, and normal Senate procedure would require 10 Republicans to join with Democrats so that any measure can break the 60-vote threshold required to proceed.\u201cSince mid-July, Republicans have clearly stated that Democrats will need to raise the debt limit on their own,\u201d McConnell wrote in the letter. \u201cWe have simply warned that since your party wishes to govern alone, it must handle the debt limit alone as well.\u201dAdvertisementStory continues below advertisementBut Biden appeared to take the reconciliation pathway off the table Monday, arguing the process would be cumbersome and could take too long to accomplish. Biden beseeched McConnell to simply allow Democrats to vote on the debt ceiling hike by not filibustering the measure \u2014 an option that would not require any GOP votes, but to allow Democrats to proceed on the motion without obstruction.\u201cThey need to stop playing Russian roulette with the U.S. economy,\u201d Biden said of the GOP. \u201cNot only are Republicans refusing to do their job, but threatening to use their power to prevent us from doing our job \u2014 saving the economy from a catastrophic event \u2014 I think, quite frankly, is hypocritical, dangerous, and disgraceful. Their obstruction and irresponsibility knows absolutely no bounds.\u201dIn a sign of the intensifying effort to address the debt ceiling, Senate Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) sent a letter to his colleagues Monday and told them that Congress must resolve the looming debt ceiling cliff \u201cby the end of this week.\u201d Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has told lawmakers Treasury could hit the \u201cX Date\u201d when it runs out of \u201cemergency measures\u201d to pay its obligations on Oct. 18, but stressed there is substantial uncertainty surrounding that projection.U.S. default this fall would cost 6 million jobs, wipe out $15 trillion in wealth, study saysSchumer also said lawmakers should not wait until the last minute to approve the measure. The budget battles over the debt ceiling of 2011 and 2013 under the Obama administration cost the U.S. economy as much as $180 billion and 1.2 million jobs by 2015, one economic analysis found. Fitch Ratings has recently warned that the U.S. could be hit with a credit downgrade as brinkmanship continues over the matter, which could drive up the costs of borrowing.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementSchumer\u2019s letter added: \u201cWe do not have the luxury of waiting until October 18, as it is our responsibility to reassure the world that the United States meets our obligations in a timely fashion and that the full faith and credit of the United States should never be in question. The consequences of even approaching the X date could be disastrous for our economy and devastating to American families.\u201dThe White House has examined unilateral measures to deal with the debt ceiling, even circulating internal memos reviewing the possibility of minting a $1 trillion coin to finance the government\u2019s debt. The administration has ruled out those ideas as impractical and likely to still lead to financial calamity.Story continues below advertisementCongressional Republicans have uniformly backed McConnell\u2019s position on the matter. They have pointed to Biden\u2019s decision not to vote for raising the debt ceiling while he was a senator. Biden rejected that criticism on Monday, arguing his votes were different because he did so as part of an up-or-down vote that passed anyway.Advertisement\u201cBiden opposed raising the debt ceiling three times. And now he\u2019s sanctimoniously lecturing Republicans about responsibility as he pushes for a $3.5 trillion reckless spending plan,\u201d Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) said on Twitter in response to Biden\u2019s speech. \u201cGive me a break.\u201dSenior Biden aides privately explored whether payments could continue even if U.S. breached debt ceilingIn recent guidance, the Senate chamber\u2019s rule-keeper acknowledged that Democrats theoretically could try to raise the debt ceiling through reconciliation, which requires only a simple majority rather than 60 votes for the Senate to proceed, according to an aide who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe the document. This news was first reported by Punchbowl News.But the parliamentarian\u2019s guidance also acknowledged the process could be lengthy, the source added, requiring a long debate over potentially endless amendments. That ultimately could delay the process until after the October 18 deadline, raising the risk of default.", "analysis": {"neg": 0.155, "neu": 0.765, "pos": 0.08, "compound": -0.9981}}, {"textData": "", "analysis": {"neg": 0.0, "neu": 0.0, "pos": 0.0, "compound": 0.0}}]
